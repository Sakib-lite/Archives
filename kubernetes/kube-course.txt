Controller Manager
  Node Controller
    - Monitoring status of the node every 5s . and keep the application running.
    - grace period 40s
    - pod eviction timeout 5m 

  Replication Controller
    - monitor the status of replica setv
    - High availibility
    - run more than one pod at same time. if one crashed,another one will be running
    - in spec there will be template. on that template again put metadata and spec as child. set number of replicas as sibling of template
    - 
  Deployment Controller
  Stateful Controller
  Replicaset
    - define as same as replication controller. add 'selector' as sibling of template
    - selector is optional. it has labels. it identify what pod fall under it.
    - kubectl get replicaset
    - we can scale it. running 'kubectl scale...'

  Cronjob
  Namespace Controller
  
Kube-apiserver
  Responsible for orchestrating all operations within the cluster

Kubelet
  - Runs on each node on cluster. listens for instruction from kube api server. kube api server peridiocally fetches status reports from kubelet
  - captain of the ships. who create pods
  - Register node 
  - create pod. 
  - monitor node and pod
  - send update of pod to master via api.

KUBE PROXY
  - Runs on worker node. Backend node and frontend node communicate with kube proxy
  -

ETCD
  Distributed reialbe key value storage 

SCHEDULER
  - Schedules pod and nodes
  - which pod goes to which node
  - filter nodes
  - rank nodes
  Taint and Toleration
    - it tells the node only accept pods with toleration. but toleration defined pod can go to any node
  
  Node Selector
    - label node and specify it in node selector in pod. 
    - the main limitation of it is get the node large or medium / not small  //label:large



Monitoring
  Metrics Server
    - one metrics server per cluster
    - it retrievs metrics from node and pod , aggregates them and store them in memory
    - cAdvisor responsible for performance metrics
    - minikube addons enable metrics-server
    - 

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
  Recreate
   - destroys all nginx:1.7.0 pods and re create nginx:1.7.1 pods. has application downtime
  
  Rolling Update
   - doesn't destroys all by once. destroys few and few one. that means application don't go down


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
  ConfigMaps
   - two step. create configmap and inject into pod
   - four step. apiVersion,metadata,kind,data
  
  
  Secret
   - used for storing sensitive data
   - stored in encoded format
   - echo -n 'password' | base64
   - can be stored in volume
   

CLUSTER MAINTAINANCE

  Os Upgrades
   - if a node goes down and stays 5min. again up and all the pods go to another node. it's called podEvictionTimeout. default is 5 min in kube master


SECURITY
  TLS
   - when user tries to login it send request in encrypted with key. hacker can decrypt it with the key //asymmetric encryption
   
    Asymmetric Encryption
     - Send private key and public lock(key)  
     - ssh-keygen //generate id_rsa.key and id_rsa.pub
     - put public lock to server


skipped static pods and multiple scheduler,

point host to dns server
