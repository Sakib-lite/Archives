# Network Communication Process with Empty MAC Address Tables

<div style='color:white;border:1px solid red; padding:10px'>
Let's explain the communication process for each scenario where the MAC address tables are initially empty. The focus will be on how the MAC addresses are learned and how frames are forwarded in a network where switches have no pre-existing knowledge of the MAC addresses.

## Scenario 1: Communication from `1.1.1` to `3.3.3`

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Frame Sent from `1.1.1` to `3.3.3`**:
   - The computer with MAC address `1.1.1` on Port 1 of Switch 1 sends a frame intended for the computer with MAC address `3.3.3`.

2. **Switch 1 Checks Its MAC Address Table**:
   - Switch 1 checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address (`3.3.3`). Since the table is empty, it doesn't find an entry for `3.3.3`.
   - Switch 1 learns the source MAC address (`1.1.1`) and associates it with Port 1 in its MAC address table.

3. **Flooding the Frame**:
   - Switch 1 floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on (Port 1). The frame is sent to Port 2 and Port 24.
   - Port 24 connects to Switch 2.

4. **Switch 2 Receives the Frame on Port 24**:
   - Switch 2 receives the frame on Port 24 and learns the source MAC address (`1.1.1`), associating it with Port 24 in its MAC address table.
   - Switch 2 checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address (`3.3.3`). Since the table is empty, it doesn't find an entry for `3.3.3`.

5. **Flooding by Switch 2**:
   - Switch 2 floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on (Port 24). The frame is sent to Port 1 and Port 2.
   - Port 1 connects to the computer with MAC address `3.3.3`.

6. **Computer `3.3.3` Receives the Frame**:
   - The computer with MAC address `3.3.3` on Port 1 of Switch 2 receives the frame.

7. **Learning the Destination MAC Address**:
   - Switch 2 learns the destination MAC address (`3.3.3`) and associates it with Port 1 in its MAC address table.
   - If `3.3.3` responds, Switch 2 sends the frame back through Port 24 to Switch 1, allowing Switch 1 to learn the MAC address (`3.3.3`) and associate it with Port 24.

## Scenario 2: Communication from `2.2.2` to `4.4.4`

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Frame Sent from `2.2.2` to `4.4.4`**:
   - The computer with MAC address `2.2.2` on Port 2 of Switch 1 sends a frame intended for the computer with MAC address `4.4.4`.

2. **Switch 1 Checks Its MAC Address Table**:
   - Switch 1 checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address (`4.4.4`). Since the table is empty, it doesn't find an entry for `4.4.4`.
   - Switch 1 learns the source MAC address (`2.2.2`) and associates it with Port 2 in its MAC address table.

3. **Flooding the Frame**:
   - Switch 1 floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on (Port 2). The frame is sent to Port 1 and Port 24.
   - Port 24 connects to Switch 2.

4. **Switch 2 Receives the Frame on Port 24**:
   - Switch 2 receives the frame on Port 24 and learns the source MAC address (`2.2.2`), associating it with Port 24 in its MAC address table.
   - Switch 2 checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address (`4.4.4`). Since the table is empty, it doesn't find an entry for `4.4.4`.

5. **Flooding by Switch 2**:
   - Switch 2 floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on (Port 24). The frame is sent to Port 1 and Port 2.
   - Port 2 connects to the computer with MAC address `4.4.4`.

6. **Computer `4.4.4` Receives the Frame**:
   - The computer with MAC address `4.4.4` on Port 2 of Switch 2 receives the frame.

7. **Learning the Destination MAC Address**:
   - Switch 2 learns the destination MAC address (`4.4.4`) and associates it with Port 2 in its MAC address table.
   - If `4.4.4` responds, Switch 2 sends the frame back through Port 24 to Switch 1, allowing Switch 1 to learn the MAC address (`4.4.4`) and associate it with Port 24.

## Scenario 3: Communication from `1.1.1` to `4.4.4`

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Frame Sent from `1.1.1` to `4.4.4`**:
   - The computer with MAC address `1.1.1` on Port 1 of Switch 1 sends a frame intended for the computer with MAC address `4.4.4`.

2. **Switch 1 Checks Its MAC Address Table**:
   - Switch 1 checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address (`4.4.4`). Since the table is empty, it doesn't find an entry for `4.4.4`.
   - Switch 1 learns the source MAC address (`1.1.1`) and associates it with Port 1 in its MAC address table.

3. **Flooding the Frame**:
   - Switch 1 floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on (Port 1). The frame is sent to Port 2 and Port 24.
   - Port 24 connects to Switch 2.

4. **Switch 2 Receives the Frame on Port 24**:
   - Switch 2 receives the frame on Port 24 and learns the source MAC address (`1.1.1`), associating it with Port 24 in its MAC address table.
   - Switch 2 checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address (`4.4.4`). Since the table is empty, it doesn't find an entry for `4.4.4`.

5. **Flooding by Switch 2**:
   - Switch 2 floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on (Port 24). The frame is sent to Port 1 and Port 2.
   - Port 2 connects to the computer with MAC address `4.4.4`.

6. **Computer `4.4.4` Receives the Frame**:
   - The computer with MAC address `4.4.4` on Port 2 of Switch 2 receives the frame.

7. **Learning the Destination MAC Address**:
   - Switch 2 learns the destination MAC address (`4.4.4`) and associates it with Port 2 in its MAC address table.
   - If `4.4.4` responds, Switch 2 sends the frame back through Port 24 to Switch 1, allowing Switch 1 to learn the MAC address (`4.4.4`) and associate it with Port 24.

## Summary
In each scenario, the switches start with empty MAC address tables. As frames are sent from one device to another, the switches learn the source MAC addresses and associate them with the respective ports. When a switch receives a frame and doesn't have an entry for the destination MAC address, it floods the frame out all ports except the one it came in on. This process continues until the frame reaches the destination device. Subsequent frames can then be forwarded more efficiently using the learned MAC addresses.
